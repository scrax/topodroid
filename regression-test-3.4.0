TopoDroid Regression Tests

This is an incomplete list of things to check 

[x] install apk over an existing installation and check that it starts
    preserving the user preferences - Checked 4 customized configurations (Rodrigo)
[x] install apk without existing installation and check it starts
    with default user preferences values
    check that the directory "topodroid" is properly populated

LANGUAGES
[ ] es [ ] fr [ ] de [ ] it [ ] cn [ ] bg [ ] ru [ ] ua [ ] sl [ ] pt [ ] hu
Changed the language setting and confirmed that the language of the configuration windows changed. I can't recognize bg, ru and ua but there are 3 different languages that I don't recognize on the language settings also so I believe they are these 3 ;) (Rodrigo)

MAIN WINDOW
[x] activity level
    [x] buttons presence according to the "activity-level" - So no change on the main window but I believe that's what's expected for this windows in particular (Rodrigo)
