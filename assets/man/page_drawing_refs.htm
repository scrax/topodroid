<h4>Sketch references</h4>

This dialog is opened by the <u>Reference</u> button of the <i>Sketch</i> window.<br><p>

<ul>
<li><b>legs</b>, survey midline (white)</li>
<li><b>splays</b> (grey)</li>
<li><b>stations</b> names (violet)</li>
<li><b>grid</b>, metric or yard</li>
<li><b>scalebar</b>, reference scalebar</li>
<li><b>outline</b>, outline of another sketch</li>
</ul>

There are three grids,
<ol>
<li>a grid at 1 m spacing (dark grey)</li>
<li>a grid at 10 m spacing (grey)</li>
<li>a grid at 100 m spacing (light grey)</li>
</ol>
<br>
TopoDroid shows only the grids that are appropriate for the scale of the sketch view.
<br><p>

If there are other sketches, the outline of another sketch can be displayed (in grey) to help drawing
the sketch. Checking the box opens a new dialog to pick the sketch to display, or to clear the outline
display.<br><p>

A further checkbox [E] specifies whether the reference should be held fixed when
shifting the drawing with two fingers. This is used to adjust a PocketTopo imported drawing to the reference
in the case it gets imported with a translation.<br><p>
